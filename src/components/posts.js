    title: "The Beginning",
    post: "This is the beginning of something entirely new to me. I have no background in programming whatsoever, but here we are! I’m diving right into HTML and CSS through freeCodeCamp and YouTube tutorials to dip my toe into this new world. While I was excited and a little nervous at first, the more I learned, the more confident I became. The first month or so has gone surprisingly well, which hopefully bodes well for JavaScript—though I know there’s still a lot to learn. With each new concept, I’m gaining a sense of accomplishment and realizing just how much is out there to explore. I can’t wait to learn more and finally start making my own projects!"

    title: "JavaScript & React",
    post: "I’ve been learning (or attempting to learn) JavaScript for the past few weeks now, and I’ll admit, it’s been a bit more challenging than HTML and CSS were. Thankfully, my boyfriend has been a great support, helping me through this journey. But man, JavaScript is tough! I’ve gone through Codecademy’s and freeCodeCamp’s free programs, yet I still don’t have a solid grip on the syntax or how everything works. On the bright side, I did manage to build a “Hot and Cold” game (with a ton of help), where you guess a randomly chosen number in 6 attempts, and are told if you're cold, cool, warm, hot, or boiling! It was a great accomplishment, even if I still feel a bit lost in the code. Recently, I dipped my toe into React, and honestly, it’s been making more sense than JavaScript did—which feels a little backwards to me! The concepts like components, props, and even state management are clicking, though I still struggle with functions. But despite that, I successfully completed my first-ever React project—via a YouTube tutorial, of course! It was a movie/TV show search page, and it’s super exciting to see a working website come to life. JavaScript is still a challenge, but seeing progress with React makes me feel like things are looking up!"

    title: "Levelyn Up!",
    post: "Big update—I landed a daytime job as a bagel baker! It’s been a nice change of pace, and now that I’m working early mornings, the plan is to grind programming in the afternoons. I also decided to take a step back from JavaScript and try out Python, and honestly, the transition has been way smoother. Python just clicks better for me, and I feel like I can focus more on problem-solving rather than getting stuck on syntax. That said, the hardest part isn’t the language—it’s learning how to think like a programmer. My brain has never had to process things this way before, and sometimes it’s frustrating when I just don’t get it. But I have to remind myself that I’m still learning, and every struggle is just part of the process. No stopping now—I’ll push through the obstacles. To get more comfortable, I’ve been building small projects like password generators and alarm clocks. Those have gone well, and they’ve helped me recognize syntax patterns and common logic structures. Now, my next goal is to build as many projects as I can in any language I’ve touched so far. I’m calling the folder/repo 'levelynup', and I’m crossing my fingers that this challenge helps me break through to the next level. Time to get to work!"

    post: "Even with all my levelynup projects, something still isn’t fully clicking when it comes to programming. I’ll build a project, but when I move on to something new, I struggle to remember how to apply what I’ve learned outside of that one specific problem. It’s frustrating because I had this same issue with math all throughout school—my brain just resists this kind of problem-solving. UGH. It’s like my mind is closed off to thinking this way, and I’m forcing it open. But I’m not stopping. I’ve made 24 projects so far, and now I’m switching things up again—I’m giving React another shot. The plan is to build a bunch of projects in React, maybe even redo some of my previous ones but with a new approach. Hoping this helps things stick more. I’ll post an update soon on where I’m at with levelynup and if this new approach is working! Oh, and big life update—we’re moving to Brooklyn in August! That means it’s really time to grind so I can land a frontend job and pay that rent. No more playing around. Time to level up for real. 🚀"

    post:
      "With the craziness of the move, I haven’t been able to program as much as I wanted, but now that we’re finally settled in Brooklyn, I’ve got all the time in the world! No more distractions—it’s time to lock in. The plan is simple: code every single day until I have enough solid projects to build out a portfolio. Hopefully, that happens sooner rather than later! One thing I know is holding me back is syntax. It still trips me up way more than I’d like, so my new approach is to rewrite a project over and over until I’ve completely memorized the syntax and actually understand what the code is doing. No more just getting something to work and moving on—I need this stuff to stick. That said, I do feel like my overall skills have improved a lot, and I’m finally at a point where I can start working on some fun personal projects. Excited to see where this next phase takes me. Wish me luck!"

    title: "Portfolio Brainstorm",
    post:
      "Okay! I’ve been grinding out projects that are actually fun to build, and I’m learning so much just by doing. Lately, I’ve been experimenting with API requests in some of my apps, which has been super cool to implement. Plus, my boyfriend helped me dive into some small backend projects, just so I can get a basic understanding of what’s going on behind the scenes. Definitely still more to learn, but it feels good to have at least some backend knowledge under my belt. Now, I think it’s finally time to build a portfolio! I’ll need a few more big projects to really make it stand out, but I’m officially in brainstorm mode. Gotta come up with some solid ideas that will not only showcase my skills but also be fun to create. Excited for this next step—let’s go!"

    title: "Building Apps and a Vision",
    post:
      "Lately, I’ve been making some new projects that I’m really excited about. But what’s even cooler is that I’m finally having app ideas on my own. That in itself took a long time to develop, but now that I’m coming up with ideas, coding has become so much more fun. It feels amazing to build my own vision and create useful apps for myself, my friends, and my family. One project I’m especially proud of is Mappi—a neighborhood finder for NYC. When we moved, figuring out where to live was overwhelming. Streeteasy and Google Maps were helpful but so tedious when I wanted to quickly see what was nearby. So I built Mappi! It lets you locate and layer places you want to live near, like gyms, dog parks, and metro stations. It’s actually so useful, and if we stay another year, I’ll definitely be using it again. On the portfolio side of things, I have tons of ideas, but bringing them to life has been hard—mainly because I’m not a designer at all. I can recognize a great-looking website, but I struggle to pinpoint why it looks so good. And every time I attempt my own designs, they just look so plain—like straight-up HTML from the early 2000s. Clearly, I need to do more research and expose myself to better design practices. Time to level up my eye for design!"

    title: "Full Speed Ahead!",
    post:
      "It's officially 2025, and I’ve been pumping out projects! I’ve built online versions of fun kid games like Hangman and Farkle (which was way more complicated than I expected), plus a bunch of useful apps for my daily life. One of my favorites is Pup Progress, a dog training catalog app where you can either follow a structured, chapter-based training style or go freestyle with different tricks. I really pushed myself on the design for this one, using Dribbble for inspiration—and I think I’m finally starting to develop an eye for UI! Another project I’m super excited about is Cart Compare. Grocery shopping in NYC is wildly expensive, so I built an app where you input your grocery items, when you bought them, how much they cost, and where you got them. The app then generates a graph and data breakdown showing when and where you’re getting the best (or worst) prices. It’s already helped me save money, so that’s a win! Oh, and my brother had a request—he’s a whitewater kayak instructor, and kayakers rely on these outdated, clunky websites to check river conditions. So I built a river gauge app with a clean UI and an API that pulls real-time cubic feet per second (CFS) data for rivers in the Northeast. It was an awesome project that helped me get more comfortable with API fetching. On top of all that, I’m finally starting to implement my portfolio site! I’ve been checking out other frontend portfolios for ideas, and it’s been fun seeing what’s possible. Hoping to have it up and running by February so I can start applying for jobs. Big things ahead—let’s go!"

    post:
      "January flew by, but thankfully, I’ve made solid progress on my portfolio! I’ve also started trying out LeetCode to prep for technical interviews—those make me so nervous, mostly because I’ve never actually done one before. Just hoping a company will take a chance on me (yes, that’s an ABBA reference). Outside of the portfolio grind, I’ve built even more cool apps! Some of my recent projects include: * Recipe Creator & Catalog – basically a digital recipe book * Food Journal – a simple app to track meals * Period Tracker – self-explanatory but super helpful * Bookmark Hub – a central place to save and organize links * Quiz App – inspired by my lack of usefulness on trivia teams I also feel way more comfortable in React now, which has made building these apps even more fun. And the big news—my portfolio will be DONE by March (but hopefully tomorrow so I can start applying ASAP!). I’m so excited for people to finally see the site and all the projects I’ve been working on. Fingers crossed it all goes well!! 🤞🏻"
